                        <h3> Overnight Biga Bread </h3>
                        <p> We're starting with the basics: bread. We haven't met a single person who didn't like bread
                            and we bet you haven't either (and people who do keto don't dislike bread, they're just 
                            afraid of it, ok?) This bread is an overnight biga bread, which is a gorgeous loaf that
                            is risen overnight and incredibly flavorful. As a college student with such little time,
                            you often don't have time to see the whole bread process through in one day, so let's break
                            it up into two and let the night do the work for you!

                        <h3> Authentic Asada </h3>
                        <p> Grilling is an essential part of any college student's lifestyle. You may be asking
                            yourself how you can possibly grill when you live in an apartment complex. Don't be afraid
                            to invest in a large piece of equipment like a grill - where there's a will, there's a way!
                            And remember that a little circle grill works just fine for small meals and quick cooks.
                            For an authentic Mexican asada (Spanish for cookout), get a few lbs of your favorite flank
                            steak from Rancho Markets on State St. Season generously with salt, pepper, cumin, and lime
                            juice. Along with the meat, throw some veggies and tortillas on the grill. Mexican onions,
                            mushrooms, and zucchini make for delicious sides. If you're cooking for a date
                            and feeling a little cheesy, add a little cheese to the tortillas - it will melt on top 
                            and leave you with delicious, cheesy tacos! Serve with watermelon for the perfect summer
                            meal, or savor them inside the house if it's too cold outside.

                        <h3> Less Authentic Asada </h3>
                        <p> If you're looking for a slightly less authentic Mexican cuisine, trade in the asada
                            for an Eastern Washington classic, jello tacos. The jello taco movement was first pioneered by
                            our very own Kimberly, and has yet to catch on. It's up to you to bring these to
                            the front of modern eating! Simply prepare a taco on a hard shell with beans and 
                            ground beef, add your favorite toppings, and add your favorite flavor of jello.
                            Try to choose a color that compliments the other toppings so you get a variety of colors.

                        <p> Let's head even further south of the border to Guatemala! This typical Guatemalan
                            meal can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and includes the most important food
                            in Guatemala, frijoles. Frijoles negros (black beans) may be served in a number of ways,
                            including refried. Simply cook the beans in a pot with garlic and salt, put the beans in
                            the blender, and then cook a second time with some oil. To your plate, add some eggs (here 
                            they are fried but scrambled is very typical), a sauce of sauteed tomatoes, peppers, and onions,
                            crema (a tastier version of sour cream), and a little sprinkle of queso seco (similar to cotija cheese).
                            Served with homemade flour tortillas, this meal will make anyone feel at home.

                            Carbohydrates are excellent in any form, but there is something special about eating
                            them in the softest, most pillowy form known to man, the crescent roll. A true crescent
                            rolls leaves you with a buttery, flaky taste in your mouth and a warm, happy feeling in your
