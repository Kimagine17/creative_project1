                        <p> "Give me Youth to the People Superfood Kale Antioxidant-Rich Face Cleanser, or
                            give me death!" Patrick Henry really knew what he was talking about when it comes 
                            to skincare. This cleanser is the personal favorite of our creator, Hannah, and she's 
                            not the only one. This cleanser comes highly recommended by many skinfluencers, including 
                            Hannah's own personal skinfluencer, Skincare by Hyram (look him up on YouTube!). 
                            Featuring a plethora of gorgeous ingredients, this cleanser cleans without stripping. 
                            It is simply the highest quality cleanser out there and at an affordable price too!

                        <h3> L'Oreal Paris Double Extend Beauty Tubes (Blackest Black) </h3>
                        <p> This mascara is truly the GOAT. With the primer attached, you'll never be stuck without it.
                            The length and volume are perfect for those who like a natural look, but multiple layers
                            add length and volume for those who like a bolder look. However the true highlight of this 
                            masterpiece is the ease with which it is removed. Magically, this mascara is removed using
                            water only, and doesn't smear under your eyes! It comes off gently in chunks and is 100% 
                            removable. Talk about college hacks!

                            for college students. It's incredibly affordable, high quality, and becoming easily available.

                            AHA and BHA in such high quantities, it's sure to keep your skin feeling smooth and healthy.

                        <p> Contrary to your mother-in-law's opinion, tap water really is the best water. Chock full of
                            minerals and nutrients that you need to start your day (including a double serving of bleach!),
                            tap water has so many amazing health benefits. Keep your organs in a constant state of panic and 
                            delight with the thrills of tap water. Tag us with pictures of your faucet!
